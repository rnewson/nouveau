targeted dreyfus feature parity

* pagination (bookmark I guess)
* grouping
* faceting
* partitioned db support

not targeted

* stale=ok
* highlighting
* drilldown

After reaching dreyfus parity, nouveau will diverge;

* no javascript eval
* ddoc will require an index schema, mapping couchdb document fields to lucene fields
* spatial-extras and spatial3d support

interim ideas

* append type to field name, so `index("foo", 12.0")` becomes `new DoublePoint("foo<number>", 12.0)`
* set a special Map to setPointsConfigMap() which examines that suffix and returns a PointsConfig for <number>

* in nouveau branch of couchdb, remove dreyfus entirely and put nouveau at _search_analyze, _search,




bookmark algorithm

do it at the end
extract range from each hit's order using mem3:shard/2, keep the last result for each range

ukeymerge it with previous bookmark if passed
